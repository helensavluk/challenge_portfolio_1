# Task 1: Software configuration
## Subtask1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
### I decided to  participate in this challenge to learn a new profession. This will allow me to understand if this profession fits me and will let me explore the career path further. 
### Since I was forced to move out of my home and can't go back, I am trying to start a new life here in Warsaw. Being in a new country and starting a life from scratch gives me an opportunity to try new stuff.  
### I hope to obtain new skills in QA in order to find new job and advance in my career path. Since I tried manual QA in game dev and liked it I think that QAA could be an interesting job for me. 
### By the end of the project I hope to have skills and proofs to apply for internships or junior positions. 
### I am grateful for everyone who decided to organize this course and contributed their time.
